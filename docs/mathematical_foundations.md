# Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Consciousness Framework

## Core Mathematical Components

### 1. Quantum State Representation
The n-qubit quantum system is represented in a 2ⁿ-dimensional Hilbert space. The initial state is prepared in a balanced superposition:

ψ₀ = 1/√(2ⁿ) * ∑[i=0 to 2ⁿ-1] |i⟩

### 2. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) Implementation
The quantum version of IIT's Φ measure is computed using the Quantum Fisher Information:

Φ ≈ F_Q(ρ, A) / (2 * ∑[i,j] (λᵢ+λⱼ))

where:
- F_Q is the Quantum Fisher Information
- ρ is the density matrix
- A is the observable
- λᵢ are eigenvalues of ρ

### 3. Quantum Information Geometry

#### 3.1 Fubini-Study Metric
The Fubini-Study metric on quantum state manifold:

G_ij = Re(⟨∂_iψ|∂_jψ⟩) = g_μν

This metric is used for optimization on the quantum state manifold.

#### 3.2 Bures Distance
Distance measure between quantum states:

D_B(ρ, σ) = √(2-2√F(ρ, σ))

where F(ρ, σ) is the quantum fidelity.

### 4. Quantum Dynamics

#### 4.1 Non-Equilibrium Evolution
The system evolves according to the quantum master equation:

∂ρ/∂t = -i/[ħ] [H(t), ρ] + Λ(ρ, t)

where:
- H(t) is the time-dependent Hamiltonian
- Λ(ρ, t) represents non-unitary evolution

#### 4.2 Geometric Phase
For cyclic evolution, the geometric phase is computed as:

γ = i ∮ ⟨ψ|d|ψ⟩

### 5. Cognitive Architecture Integration

#### 5.1 Quantum Cup Product
Integration of perception, attention, and memory:

a ∗_q b ≈ (Perception ∪ Attention)β q^{⟨β,ω⟩} (Memory)

Parameters:
- β: Coupling strength
- ω: Frequency parameter

#### 5.2 Parallel Transport
Parallel transport of quantum states preserves geometric structure:

∇_X|ψ⟩ = 0

where ∇_X is the covariant derivative along X.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Numerical Stability
- Eigenvalue thresholding: ε = 1e-10

- Input validation for quantum states
- Dimension compatibility checks
- Numerical precision monitoring

## Mathematical Properties

### 1. Conservation Laws
- Probability conservation: Tr(ρ) = 1
- Energy conservation (in absence of dissipation)
- Quantum Fisher Information positivity

### 2. Geometric Properties
- Metric positive-definiteness
- Triangle inequality for Bures distance
- Parallel transport preserves inner products

### 3. Cognitive Processing
- Normalization preservation in cup product
- Coherence measures
- Information integration bounds

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. State Preparation
```python
# Initialize quantum system
qs = QuantumSystem(n_qubits=10)

# Prepare custom state
custom_state = create_balanced_superposition(n_qubits)
qs.set_state(custom_state)
```

### 2. Evolution and Measurement
```python
# Time evolution
evolution = qs.time_evolution(dt=0.1, steps=100)

# Compute Φ measure
phi = qs.compute_phi_measure()

# Calculate geometric phase
phase = qs.compute_geometric_phase(cycle)
```

### 3. Cognitive Operations
```python
# Compute quantum cup product
result = qs.compute_quantum_cup_product(
    perception=perception_state,
    attention=attention_state,
    memory=memory_state
)

# Evolve cognitive state
evolution = qs.evolve_cognitive_state(
    initial_state=initial,
    perception_sequence=perceptions,
    attention_sequence=attentions
)
```
